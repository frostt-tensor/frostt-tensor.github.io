title: Chicago Crime

description: >
  Crime reports in the city of Chicago, ranging from January 1st, 2001 to
  December 11th, 2017. Non-zeros are counts and modes provide information
  such as time, location, and type of crime. Specifically, we provide two
  tensors:

  * Modes *day-hour-community-crimetype*, where a
    community is one of the
    [communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago) of
    Chicago.
  * Modes *day-hour-latitude-longitude-crimetype*, where latitudes and longitudes
    are rounded to three decimal places. Note that the first mode (*day*) is
    one shorter than the community-based tensor. This indicates that one day
    had missing latitudes or longitudes, but not community area.


  In both tensors, the crimetype mode is the `Primary Type` field found in the
  original
  [data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2).


  Some basic sanitization efforts have been undertaken by FROSTT:

    * Reports without a location are omitted.
    * A single mistaken crime report (out of 6.5M total) of the secondary crime 
      type `DOMESTIC VIOLENCE` has been moved to the primary crime type 
      `BATTERY`.
      Secondary crime types are sub-categories of primary crime types.
    * Instances of community area `0` are omitted (only `1`-`77` are valid).
