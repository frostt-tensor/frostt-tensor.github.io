title: Amazon Reviews

description: >
  Product reviews from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) and collected by
  [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html). The modes represent
  *user-product-word*, and each non-zero is the number of times a word appears
  in a given review. We pre-processed the review text by removing stop
  words and performing Porter stemming.
  
  
  Please note that we no longer have the mappings for this dataset. It is
  provided as a peformance benchmark.
