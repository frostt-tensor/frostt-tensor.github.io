title: Enron Emails

description: >
  Enron emails released during an investigation by the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission. The modes represent *sender-receiver-word-date*, and
  the values are counts of words. Email senders and recipients outside of the
  *@enron.com* domain were pruned. English stop words were pruned and
  Porter stemming was used on the remaining words. Words which appear fewer
  than five times were also pruned.
